# Understanding Analog Content

Analog provides a powerful content management system that allows you to author content in Markdown and seamlessly integrate it into your Angular applications.

## Content Features

### Frontmatter Support

Every markdown file can include frontmatter with metadata:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Title"
date: "2024-01-20"
excerpt: "Brief description"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
---
```

### injectContent Function

The `injectContent` function allows you to load content dynamically:

```typescript
import { injectContent } from "@analogjs/content";

const content = injectContent<BlogPost>({
  slug: "my-post",
  subdirectory: "blog",
});
```

### Markdown Components

Analog provides components for rendering markdown:

```typescript
import { MarkdownComponent } from '@analogjs/content';

// In your template
<analog-markdown [content]="content()"></analog-markdown>
```

## Best Practices

1. Use descriptive frontmatter
2. Organize content in subdirectories
3. Leverage TypeScript interfaces for type safety
4. Use the `injectContent` function for dynamic loading

This approach provides a clean separation between content and presentation while maintaining type safety.
